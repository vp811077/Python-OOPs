        "\n",
        "1. **Modularity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Code is organized into **classes** and **objects**, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reusability:**\n",

        "   * Once a class is created, it can be **reused** in multiple programs, reducing redundancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Scalability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * OOP makes it easier to **scale programs** by adding new classes and objects without affecting existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Maintainability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Encapsulation ensures that objects hide their internal data. Changes in one part of the program **don’t affect other parts**, making maintenance simpler.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Data Security:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * **Encapsulation** allows data to be hidden (private), reducing the chance of accidental modification.\n",

        "6. **Inheritance:**\n",

        "   * Classes can **inherit properties and methods** from other classes, promoting code reuse and logical hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Polymorphism:**\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans: **Multiple Inheritance in Python** is when a **class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class**.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. A child class can access **methods and variables from multiple parent classes**.\n",
        "2. Python resolves conflicts using the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**, which determines the order in which parent classes are searched when calling a method.\n",
        "3. It allows **code reuse** from multiple classes but should be used carefully to avoid complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Syntax Example:\n",

        "✅ **Explanation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* `Child` inherits from both `Father` and `Mother`.\n",
